# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Action that runs code-coverage analysis and posts a diff/patch-coverage pull-request comment using the [omni-dev](https://github.com/rust-works/omni-dev) CLI tool. It is the coverage counterpart to [action-works/omni-dev-commit-check](https://github.com/action-works/omni-dev-commit-check) and reuses that action's omni-dev install + cache pattern verbatim.

## Repository Structure

- `action.yml` - The composite GitHub Action definition (the core of this project)
- `README.md` - User documentation with examples and input/output reference
- `.omni-dev/` - Project guidelines for commits and PRs
- `.github/workflows/commit-check.yml` - Dogfoods the commit-check action on this repo
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template

## How It Works

The action is a composite action with two phases:

1. **Install omni-dev** (carried over from omni-dev-commit-check): resolve the
   version (`latest` → newest release tag, or a pinned value), restore the
   `~/.cargo/bin/omni-dev` cache (`actions/cache@v4`), and on a miss download a
   pre-built release binary, falling back to `cargo install omni-dev`.
2. **Coverage pipeline**:
   - **Fat mode (default, `run-coverage: true`)**: set up `llvm-tools-preview` +
     `cargo-llvm-cov`, run `cargo test` under instrumentation (sourcing
     `cargo llvm-cov show-env --sh` per step so every cargo step shares one set
     of instrumented dependency artifacts), then emit `codecov.json`, the
     per-line `report` lcov, and a `--summary-only` summary.
   - **Thin mode (`run-coverage: false`)**: skip cargo-llvm-cov entirely; the
     caller supplies the per-line lcov via the `report` input.
   - On pull requests: compute the `origin/main`..`HEAD` merge-base, download the
     `coverage-baseline` artifact for that exact commit, and on a miss recompute
     it in a git worktree (fat mode). Render the comment with
     `omni-dev coverage diff` and post it via
     `marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment`.
   - On pushes to `main`: publish this run's lcov as the `coverage-baseline`
     artifact.
   - **Gates run last** so the summary and PR comment still post when a gate
     fails: `--fail-under-patch` (patch coverage) then
     `cargo llvm-cov report --fail-under-lines` (overall line coverage).

## Key Technical Details

- **Binary source**: the action runs the *installed* `omni-dev` (on PATH from
  `~/.cargo/bin`), not a `target/debug/omni-dev` built by the coverage run — that
  is the whole point of the install/cache phase, and it is what lets thin mode
  work without any cargo build.
- **Baseline is pinned to the merge-base**, not "latest main", so per-file
  deltas are attributable to the PR alone.
- **`worktree-system-deps`** generalizes the one omni-dev-specific wrinkle from
  the original inline job (installing `libasound2-dev` before building old
  history); it installs nothing unless set.
- **`setup-commands` / `extra-test-commands`** let a caller whose coverage corpus
  isn't a single `cargo test` run still use fat mode (e.g. omni-voice: download a
  Whisper model, then run `--ignored` model-gated suites). `setup-commands` runs
  pre-test with `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=/dev/null` (reuses the instrumented build,
  contributes no coverage); `extra-test-commands` runs post-test and DOES
  contribute. Both are skipped in the worktree recompute, so the merge-base stays
  buildable at old fork points and only `test-args` defines that baseline.
- **Gate ordering**: the comment-building diff is run WITHOUT `--fail-under-patch`
  so a failing gate never blocks the comment; the gate is enforced by a separate
  diff invocation after the comment step.
- **Secrets** (e.g. the codecov token) must be passed as inputs — composite
  actions cannot read `secrets` directly.

## Commit and PR Guidelines

This project uses conventional commits with required scopes. See `.omni-dev/commit-guidelines.md` for details.

**Scopes**: `action`, `docs`, `ci`

**Example commits**:
```
feat(action): add fail-under-patch input
fix(action): handle missing baseline artifact gracefully
docs(docs): add thin-mode usage example
```
